I have asked her to continue wearing her lumbar brace. She is also educated regarding proper dieting. Additionally she is a candidate for physical therapy with range of motion, core strengthening exercises. I will follow the patient in clinic to monitor her progress after physical therapy has been completed. I have also asked her to see her primary medical doctor for diabetic control as well.
